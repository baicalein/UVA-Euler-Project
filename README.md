Load the data from the class hardware survey into memory using pandas, manipulate that data into a binnable form, and make exploratory histographs of the features of the dataset. For the features you couldn't address with a histogram provide a qualitative description.
Prepare for presentation your findings from the class hardware data using a markdown file in your repo. Share your mini presentation with another member of your cohort.

1. Number of trials for the Binomial distribution: N=10000
2. Probability of success for each trial: p=0.5
3. Generates 10,000 samples from a Binomial distribution with parameters 𝑁 and p
4. In Binomial Ddistribution: mean 𝜇 = 𝑁𝑝 and variance 𝜎2=𝑁𝑝(1−𝑝)
5. Generates 10,000 samples from a Normal distribution with mean 𝜇 and standard deviation 𝜎
6. Create histogram for each distribution to compare
7. Observe the Binomial distribution resembles the Normal distribution as N becomes large by comparing two histogram.
